What is ChatGPT?

ChatGPT is an open-source dialogue system powered by artificial intelligence (AI) natural language processing (NLP) technology. It acts as a chatbot, responding to user queries through conversations. It uses a deep learning framework called OpenAI GPT-3 to generate accurate results backed by machine learning algorithms.

What is NLP?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) and encompasses various techniques used to process and analyze data in natural languages. It includes topics such as speech tagging, natural language understanding, parts of speech, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling, among others.

What is Deep Learning?

Deep learning is an area of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that deals with teaching machines how to learn from data. It is a type of Machine Learning (ML) based on algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artificial neural networks. These networks are capable of perceived inputs and produce a meaningful output given certain parameters.

What is AI?

AI stands for Artificial Intelligence, which is the field of computer science that deals with creating intelligent machines capable of performing tasks that usually would require human intelligence. Examples of Artificial Intelligence include language understanding, visual perception, decision making, automated reasoning and problem solving.

What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that deals with teaching machines how to learn from data. It enables machines to use algorithms to understand patterns in data and accurately predict outcomes without instructions.

What is Neural Network?

A neural network is an artificial intelligence technique which models the structure and functions of a biological neural network. It consists of multiple connected layers of nodes which are modeled after interconnected neurons in the brain. The neurons are arranged in layers and communicate with other neurons in different layers of the network.

What is GPT-3?

GPT-3 is a natural language processing (NLP) model that is created by OpenAI. It is built on a powerful algorithm called the Generative Pre-trained Transformer, which builds on top of advances in unsupervised machine learning (ML) and deep learning algorithms. GPT-3 has been trained on a diverse set of text including fiction and nonfiction, web text, and academic articles. The result is a powerful text generator and language understanding model

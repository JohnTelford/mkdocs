intrative development

What Is Iterative Development?
ChatGPT

Iterative development is an approach to software development in which the process of development is broken down into smaller pieces that are repeated over time. Each cycle of development involves designing, coding, and testing a part of the application. This style of development helps speed up the development process by breaking down large, complex problems into smaller tasks that can be worked on in parallel. It also allows developers to better identify issues that arise during development as they are encountered, rather than waiting until the end of development to find any problems.

Visual Studio Code and Git Commands
Using Visual Studio (VS) Code to access your Git repository is a great way to manage your code. Let's take a look at the basic commands you'll need to master!

Cloning a Repository
To clone an existing Git repository from a remote server, use the git clone command:

Copy
Insert
New
git clone <remote_repo_url>
Making Changes
Once you have cloned the repository, you can make changes to it. Ensure that you are in the working directory of the repository and create a new branch if required:

Copy
Insert
New
git branch <your_branch_name>
Make changes to the code, then add the modified files to the staging area:

Copy
Insert
New
git add <filename1> <filename2> <filepath>
You can also add all changed files to the staging area with the -A flag:

Copy
Insert
New
git add -A
Commit your changes:

Copy
Insert
New
git commit -m "<commit_message>"
Pushing Your Changes
Push your changes to the remote repository:

Copy
Insert
New
git push origin <your_branch_name>
If your changes are accepted and merged, you will be able to see them on the remote repository.

Pulling Changes
It's important to update your local repository in order to get the latest changes from the remote repository. To do this, use the git pull command:

Copy
Insert
New
git pull origin <your_branch_name>
This will pull the changes from the remote repository into your local repository, ensuring you have the updated code.

vscode built in git commands
Using VSCode's built-in Git commands is relatively simple. To start, you'll need to initiate a local repository using the git init command.

Once your local repo has been initiated, it's time to start adding and committing changes. This can be done by running git add . which will add all new/modified files in your working tree. These files can then be committed either one at a time by running git commit -m "<message>" or in one go with git commit -am "message".

If you want to push the changes to a remote repository such as GitHub, you can simply run git push <remote> <branch> where <remote> is the remote name and <branch> is the branch you want to push to.

Finally, don't forget to pull down changes from remote repositories with git pull <remote> <branch>. This will pull down any changes made since your last pull from that remote branch.

Hope this answered your question!

Reaching a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is the first goal of a Development team. In order to do this, the team must first go through the stages of Define, Design, Develop, Deploy, and Maintenance.

The Define stage helps teams understand the project and its requirements. The Design stage identifies the user experience and the core foundations needed in order to have a successful website. The Develop stage takes the designs created in the first two stages and turns them into user facing pages. Next, the Deploy stage takes the works on the Develop stage and makes it available to anyone with internet access. Last, the Maintenance Stage accounts for any unforeseen defects/bugs related to security, design, or programming that arise throughout the project. It is important to address these issues to ensure efficient, cost-effective development process.

## Version Control

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later

## VCS
A version control system, or VCS, tracks the history of changes as people and teams collaborate on projects together. As developers make changes to the project, any earlier version of the project can be recovered at any time.

<!-- Iterative Website Development -->

This site is about optimizing website development costs. It describes developing websites using Iterative Website Development.

Creating, adding feature, adding function, and maintaining websites that meet users needs is difficult, complex, time consuming, and expensive. Supporting Team members costs for website  projects, is a large part of a website total lifetime costs.

> Some times companies may have little interest in how their websites are constructed, as long as they have the features and functionality needed to satisfy their target market. The cost of errors, security, remediations, adding features, and functionality, during the life time of the website, dramatically increases website lifetime costs.


## What is Iterative Website Development¶

It is a way of creating websites using web development disciplines and technologies to reduce website lifetime cost. Web sites software development is a process that requires teamwork and cooperation.

## Primary Technologies 

### Developer Workstation

[Workstations](workstations.md) are the prime technology for team members. Workstation down time is catastrophic for team members. Their productivity has been halted because their connection to the website project is severed.

Having workstations that are:

- Fast
- Reliable
- Supportable
- Secure
- Support Large or Multiple Screens
- Run Software Development Applications

> Save development costs

### MkDocs

Material MkDocs, commonly referred to as MkDocs, is a static website generator. It compiles Markdown source files into standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript web browser languages files, and places them on an internal MkDocs web server. The developer access the MkDocs web server the workstation browser.

Creating websites using the standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript web browser requires developers who know these languages and are able to use them. Creating websites with MkDocs only requires knowing Markdown, not a strict foreign language

Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.

Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

Markdown’s syntax uses punctuation characters, which have been carefully chosen so as to look like what they mean. E.g., asterisks around a word actually look like emphasis. Markdown lists look like, well, lists. Even block-quotes look like quoted passages of text, assuming you’ve ever used email.

Built-in formatting commands are quicker and easier to use than manually typing the Markdown punctuation characters.

The compiling process can also be done by a Content Delivery Network using MkDocs to compile the Markdown files and places them on an internal MkDocs web server. The Content Delivery Network deploys MkDocs web server to the Internet.

What the developer sees on the workstation is exactly what the Content Delivery Network delivers to the Internet.

Configuring the Content Delivery Network enables developers to frequently deploy their work to private internet Previews website for stakeholders, interested parties, and other Teams to see their work and provide feedback.

MkDocs helps develop websites faster.

### Markdown

The primary MkDocs website programming language is Markdown, not the standard HTML,CSS, and JavaScript languages. Each is a strict foreign language requiring developers who know the languages and are able to use them . The Markdown language

Using Markdown is different then using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.

For example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., **this text is bold**). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text, especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications

### Overview

Iterative development is an approach to software development in which the process of development is broken down into smaller pieces that are repeated over time. Each cycle of development involves designing, coding, and testing a part of the application. This style of development helps speed up the development process by breaking down large, complex problems into smaller tasks that can be worked on in parallel. It also allows developers to better identify issues that arise during development as they are encountered, rather than waiting until the end of development to find any problems.


This website provides information on reducing costs in website development using iterative development, web components and static site generator. Private preview websites can be deployed to allow stakeholders to monitor progress and provide feedback, speeding up the development process. The focus is finding defects early during development to minimize overall costs over the life time of the website project.

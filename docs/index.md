Iterative project development is a way of creating projects using development disciplines and technologies to reduce website lifetime cost. It requires teamwork and cooperation from all members of the teams. Team members will collaborate to iterate, test new functionality, and remediate defects, of the project under development or deployed, to lower lifetime costs.

Creating, adding features, functions, security, and maintaining websites that meet users needs is difficult, complex, time consuming, and expensive. The cost of defects, security, remediation's, adding features, and functionality, during the lifetime of the website, dramatically increases website lifetime costs. Companies may have little interest in how their websites are constructed, as long as they have the features and functionality needed to satisfy their target market.

This site is about lowering project development costs. It describes project development using iterative project development technology. An example of this technology is the website itself, which was built and maintained using iterative project development technology.

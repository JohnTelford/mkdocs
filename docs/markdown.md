### Markdown

Markdown is the programming language MkDocs uses for creating websites, not the standard browser HTML,CSS, and JavaScript languages. These programming languages are strict foreign language requiring developers to know the languages and are able to use them. Markdown use spoken languages

Using Markdown is different then using a word processing editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isnâ€™t like that. 

This website files are written in Markdown. Adding Markdown syntax to them produces the formatted text you are reading. The website files with Markdown syntax are readable by themselves, unlike word processing.

The [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org) explains how to use Markdown, the simple and easy-to-use markup language you can use to format virtually any document, not just website files.

> Markdown can be used for everything. People use it to create websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation.

> Markdown is portable. Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using virtually any application. 

> Markdown is platform independent
 
> Markdown's syntax is comprised entirely of punctuation characters

> Markdown-formatted text can be created on any device running any operating system

> For any markup that is not covered by Markdown's syntax, HTML can be embedded in Markdown. There's no need to preface it or delimit it to indicate that you're switching from Markdown to HTML

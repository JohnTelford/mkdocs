### Material MkDocs

[Material MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) is a theme for [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and adds Python Markdown extensions. It is a static website generator compiling
[Markdown](markdown.md) source files into standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript web browser languages files, and places them on an internal MkDocs web server.  Developers use the workstation browser to access the MkDocs web server, to see how their project will look on the Internet.

Creating websites using the standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript web browser requires developers who know these languages and are able to use them. Creating websites with MkDocs only requires knowing Markdown, not a strict foreign language

Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write.

Readability is emphasized. A Markdown-formatted document can be publishable as plain text.

Markdownâ€™s syntax uses punctuation characters, which have been carefully chosen to look like what they mean. For example, asterisks around the word `*emphasis*`  looks  *emphasis*. Double asterisks around the word `**bold**` looks   **bold**.

The compiling process can also be done by a Content Delivery Network using MkDocs to compile the Markdown files and places them on an internal MkDocs web server. The Content Delivery Network deploys the MkDocs web server to the Internet.

What the developer sees on the workstation is exactly what the Content Delivery Network delivers to the Internet.

Configuring the Content Delivery Network enables developers to frequently deploy their work to private Previews website for stakeholders, interested parties, and other Teams to see their work and provide feedback.

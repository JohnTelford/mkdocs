Material MkDocs, commonly referred to as MkDocs, is a static website generator. It compiles Markdown source files into standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript web browser languages files, and places them on an internal MkDocs web server. The developer access the MkDocs web server the workstation browser.

Creating websites using the standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript web browser requires developers who know these languages and are able to use them. Creating websites with MkDocs only requires knowing Markdown, not a strict foreign language

Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.

Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.

Markdown’s syntax uses punctuation characters, which have been carefully chosen so as to look like what they mean. E.g., asterisks around a word actually look like emphasis. Markdown lists look like, well, lists. Even block-quotes look like quoted passages of text, assuming you’ve ever used email.

Built-in formatting commands are quicker and easier to use than manually typing the Markdown punctuation characters.

The compiling process can also be done by a Content Delivery Network using MkDocs to compile the Markdown files and places them on an internal MkDocs web server. The Content Delivery Network deploys MkDocs web server to the Internet.

What the developer sees on the workstation is exactly what the Content Delivery Network delivers to the Internet.

Configuring the Content Delivery Network enables developers to frequently deploy their work to private internet Previews website for stakeholders, interested parties, and other Teams to see their work and provide feedback.

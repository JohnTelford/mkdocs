## Version Control

Version control technologies are at the center of Iterative Project Developments

### About Version Control And Git

*From [About version control and Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git#about-version-control-and-git)*

> A version control system, or VCS, tracks the history of changes as [teams](team_overview.md) collaborate on projects together. As developers make changes to the project, any earlier version of the project can be recovered at any time.

> Developers can review project history to find out:
>
- Which changes were made?
- Who made the changes?
- When were the changes made?
- Why were changes needed?
>
VCSs give each contributor a unified and consistent view of a project, surfacing work that's already in progress. Seeing a transparent history of changes, who made them, and how they contribute to the development of a project helps team members stay aligned while working independently.
> 
In a Distributed Version Control System - DVCS, every developer has a full copy of the project and project history on their workstation. [Git](git.md) is the most popular distributed version control system. [Git](git.md) is commonly used for both open source and commercial software development, with significant benefits for individuals, teams and businesses.
> 
- [Git](git.md) lets developers see the entire timeline of their changes, decisions, and progression of any project in one place. From the moment they access the history of a project, the developer has all the context they need to understand it and start contributing.
> 
- Developers work in every time zone. With a DVCS like [Git](git.md), collaboration can happen any time while maintaining source code integrity. Using branches, developers can safely propose changes to production code.
> 
- Businesses using [Git](git.md) can break down communication barriers between teams and keep them focused on doing their best work. Plus, [Git](git.md) makes it possible to align experts across a business to collaborate on major projects

### About repositories

> A repository, or [Git](git.md) project, encompasses the entire collection of files and folders associated with a project, along with each file's revision history. The file history appears as snapshots in time called commits. The commits can be organized into multiple lines of development called branches. Because [Git](git.md) is a DVCS, repositories are self-contained units and anyone who has a copy of the repository can access the entire codebase and its history. Using the command line or other ease-of-use interfaces, a [Git](git.md) repository also allows for: interaction with the history, cloning the repository, creating branches, committing, merging, comparing changes across versions of code, and more.
>
Through platforms like GitHub, Git also provides more opportunities for project transparency and collaboration. Public repositories help teams work together to build the best possible final product.

### How GitHub works

>[GitHub](github.md) hosts [Git](git.md) repositories and provides developers with tools to ship better code through command line features, issues (threaded discussions), pull requests, code review, or the use of a collection of free and for-purchase apps in the [GitHub](github.md) Marketplace. With collaboration layers like the [GitHub](github.md) flow, a community of 15 million developers, and an ecosystem with hundreds of integrations, [GitHub](github.md) changes the way software is built.
>
[GitHub](github.md) builds collaboration directly into the development process. Work is organized into repositories where developers can outline requirements or direction and set expectations for team members. Then, using the GitHub flow, developers simply create a branch to work on updates, commit changes to save them, open a pull request to propose and discuss changes, and merge pull requests once everyone is on the same page.

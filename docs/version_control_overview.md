Git is a popular Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) that tracks changes in software projects & provides a unified view of project history. Developers can see the entire timeline of changes, who made them, why, & when. Each developer has a full copy of the project & maintains source code integrity through branches. Git enables businesses to leverage collaboration and align experts. 

Repositories in Git help teams build the best product; collaboration can happen through shared repository or fork and pull model. 

GitHub is a platform that hosts Git repositories and offers tools for better code development, collaboration, and integration with other apps. It's useful for organizing work through repositories and facilitating collaboration through the GitHub flow (create branch - commit changes - open pull request - merge).

{structure}

The structure of Git and GitHub is centered around repositories and branches. Repositories are the entire collection of files and folders associated with a project and their revision history, represented as snapshots called commits. Branches in Git allow organizations of different lines of development, allowing developers to safely propose changes to the production code.

GitHub provides tools for collaboration, hosting Git repositories and offering features such as issues, pull requests, code review and integration with other apps to improve the software development process. With the GitHub flow, work is organized into repositories where developers can outline requirements and create branches for work on updates, before committing changes, opening a pull request, discussing and then merging changes, along with 15 million other developers worldwide.

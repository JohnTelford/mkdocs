Alternatives to using built-in VScode `git` commands is to use the built in terminal or [GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop) that abstract `gitHub` and with more `git` commands. It interacts with `GitHub` using a GUI instead of the command line or a web browser. 

[GitHub Desktop and VSCode](http://www.rodanthi-alexiou.com/github-101-github-desktop-and-vscode/) documents how to use GitHub Desktop with VScode.

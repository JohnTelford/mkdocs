Git tracks changes to a developer's codebase, but it's necessary to stage and take a snapshot of the changes to include them in the project's history. This command performs staging, the first part of that two-step process. Any changes that are staged will become a part of the next snapshot and a part of the project's history. Staging and committing separately gives developers complete control over the history of their project without changing how they code and work.</p>"},{"location":"git-github/#git-commit","title":"git commit","text":"<p><code>git commit</code> saves the snapshot to the project history and completes the change-tracking process.

As developers make changes to the project, any earlier version of the project can be recovered at any time. About version control and Git \u00b6 About version control and Git GitHub \u00b6 GitHub is a Distributed Version Control Systems enabling multiple teams to work separately on the same project without having an impact on the work of others. GitHub manages an online web hosted Central Website Repository containing all project files. It is a unified source of truth. It helps teams collaborate and maintain the entire history of project file changes, and helps answer the questions who changed what, where, when, and why for the lifetime of the project Getting Started \u00b6 Getting Started How GitHub works \u00b6 How GitHub works Basic Git Commands \u00b6 Basic Git Commands To use Git, developers use specific commands to copy, create, change, and combine code. These commands can be executed directly from the command line or by using an application like GitHub Desktop. Here are some common commands for using Git: git init \u00b6 git init initializes a brand new Git repository and begins tracking an existing directory. It adds a hidden subfolder within the existing directory that houses the internal data structure required for version control. git clone \u00b6 git clone creates a local copy of a project that already exists remotely. The clone includes all the project's files, history, and branches. git add \u00b6 git add stages a change. Git tracks changes to a developer's codebase, but it's necessary to stage and take a snapshot of the changes to include them in the project's history. This command performs staging, the first part of that two-step process. Any changes that are staged will become a part of the next snapshot and a part of the project's history. Staging and committing separately gives developers complete control over the history of their project without changing how they code and work. git commit \u00b6 git commit saves the snapshot to the project history and completes the change-tracking process. In short, a commit functions like taking a photo. Anything that's been staged with git add will become a part of the snapshot with git commit. git status \u00b6 git status shows the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged. git branch \u00b6 git branch shows the branches being worked on locally. git merge \u00b6 git merge merges lines of development together. This command is typically used to combine changes made on two distinct branches. For example, a developer would merge when they want to combine changes from a feature branch into the main branch for deployment. git pull \u00b6 git pull updates the local line of development with updates from its remote counterpart. Developers use this command if a teammate has made commits to a branch on a remote, and they would like to reflect those changes in their local environment. git push \u00b6 git push updates the remote repository with any commits made locally to a branch.

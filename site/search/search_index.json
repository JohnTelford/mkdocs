Each cycle of development involves designing, coding, and testing a part of the application. This style of development helps speed up the development process by breaking down large, complex problems into smaller tasks that can be worked on in parallel. It also allows developers to better identify issues that arise during development as they are encountered, rather than waiting until the end of development to find any problems.</p> <p>This website provides information on reducing costs in website development using iterative development, web components and static site generator. Private preview websites can be deployed to allow stakeholders to monitor progress and provide feedback, speeding up the development process.

The single-core Rosetta 2 benchmark running on a low end M2 MacBook Air with 8GB of RAM, is faster than other x86 Mac machines in single core benchmark.

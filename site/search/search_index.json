This simple permission structure, combined with features like protected branches, helps teams progress quickly when they adopt GitHub. For an open source project, or for projects to which anyone can contribute, managing individual permissions can be challenging, but a fork and pull model allows anyone who can view the project to contribute. A fork is a copy of a project under a developer's personal account. Every developer has full control of their fork and is free to implement a fix or a new feature. Work completed in forks is either kept separate, or is surfaced back to the original project via a pull request. There, maintainers can review the suggested changes before they're merged.

Git \u00b6 Git Tutorial Fork \u00b6 Git GitHub Fork A fork is a copy of the project repository in a team member's GitHub account. Forks let team members make changes to a project without affecting the original repository or other team members. Team members can fetch updates from the project repository with a pull command Forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project to which you do not have write access, or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea. You can fork a repository to create a copy of the repository and make changes without affecting the upstream repository Forking a repository is similar to copying a repository, with two major differences: You can use a pull request to suggest changes from your user-owned fork to the original repository in its GitHub instance, also known as the upstream repository. You can bring changes from the upstream repository to your local fork by synchronizing your fork with the upstream repository. Fork a Repo Clone \u00b6 Git Clone from GitHub A clone is a full copy of a repository, including all logging and versions of files, copied from the team member GitHub account to team member workstation. Commits keep the team member local project repository up to date on the workstation and on GitHub. If the workstation copy is damaged, the latest commit can be cloned from GitHubto the workstation. Branch \u00b6 Git Branch Creating a branch is to safely diverge from a line of development and continuing on another. An example is creating a branch create a feature or to test a radical idea Branching enables working on different parts of a project without impacting other branches. Work on a branch can be merged with other project branches. Switching between branches and work on different projects without them interfering with each other. Branching in Git is lightweight and fast! Checkout \u00b6 Switch \u00b6 Switches to a new branch A quick way of switching branch on Git is to use the git switch command and specify the name of the branch you want to switch. If the destination branch does not exist, you have to specify the \u201c-c\u201d option (for \u201ccreate branch\u201c), otherwise you will get an error message when switching to that branch. $ git switch $ git switch -c Again, as an example, let\u2019s say that you want to switch to the \u201cfeature\u201d branch from the \u201cmaster\u201d branch. In order to switch from the \u201cmaster\u201d branch to the \u201cfeature\u201d branch, use the \u201cgit switch\u201d command and specify the destination branch (which is \u201cfeature\u201d in this case) $ git switch feature switch branch using git switch On the other hand, if you try to switch to a non existing branch, you will get the following error message $ git switch non-existing-branch fatal: invalid reference: non-existing-branch To solve this error, make sure to append the \u201c-c\u201d option to the \u201cgit switch\u201d command to specify that you want to switch to a new branch. $ git switch -c non-existing-branch Switched to a new branch 'non-existing-branch' Congratulations, you have now successfully switched to another branch and you can start working on it. Git Desktop \u00b6 Git Desktop is an alternative to using VScode built-in Git commands. It abstract Github and more Git commands. It interacts with GitHub using a GUI instead of the command line or a web browser. It is a Microsoft product available on Mac and Windows. GitHub Desktop and VSCode documents explain how to use GitHub Desktop with VScode . iA Writer \u00b6 Editing Markdown / MDX website pages and blog posts using iA Writer is faster because of focus and grammar features with live preview. iA Writer is a Markdown Writing app: Faster way to write MDX website material Extensive Style Check Focus Sentence Paragraph Available for Mac, iOS, Windows, and Android The Mac iA Writer stores files in iCloud.

It helps teams collaborate and maintain the entire history of project file changes, and helps answer the questions who changed what, where, when, and why for the lifetime of the project About version control and Git Getting Started \u00b6 Getting Started How GitHub works \u00b6 How GitHub works git \u00b6 Git is the most widely used modern version control system in the world today. Git is mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel. A staggering number of software projects rely on Git for version control, including commercial projects as well as open source. Developers who have worked with Git are well represented in the pool of available software development talent and it works well on a wide range of operating systems and Integrated Development Environments such as VScode. Git Distributed Version Control System. Rather than have only one single place for the full version history of the software as in Git, every developer's working copy of the code is also a repository that can contain the full history of all changes. In addition to being distributed, Git has been designed with performance, security and flexibility in mind. Basic Git Commands \u00b6 Basic Git Commands To use Git, developers use specific commands to copy, create, change, and combine code. These commands can be executed directly from the command line or by using an application like GitHub Desktop. Here are some common commands for using Git: git init \u00b6 git init initializes a brand new Git repository and begins tracking an existing directory. It adds a hidden subfolder within the existing directory that houses the internal data structure required for version control. git clone \u00b6 git clone creates a local copy of a project that already exists remotely. The clone includes all the project's files, history, and branches. git add \u00b6 git add stages a change. Git tracks changes to a developer's codebase, but it's necessary to stage and take a snapshot of the changes to include them in the project's history. This command performs staging, the first part of that two-step process. Any changes that are staged will become a part of the next snapshot and a part of the project's history. Staging and committing separately gives developers complete control over the history of their project without changing how they code and work. git commit \u00b6 git commit saves the snapshot to the project history and completes the change-tracking process. In short, a commit functions like taking a photo. Anything that's been staged with git add will become a part of the snapshot with git commit. git status \u00b6 git status shows the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged. git branch \u00b6 git branch shows the branches being worked on locally. git merge \u00b6 git merge merges lines of development together. This command is typically used to combine changes made on two distinct branches. For example, a developer would merge when they want to combine changes from a feature branch into the main branch for deployment. git pull \u00b6 git pull updates the local line of development with updates from its remote counterpart.

A 2019 survey reported 5G hype is working as 1/3 of smartphone owners thought they had a 5G devices and service, but they didn't. Since then, major carriers have ramped up their hype machines and they are working. More 5G phones being are being sold now, but more smartphone owners think they have reliable 5G service, but they don't. A few of those with 5G smartphones are experiencing 5G service. Illinois has the top 5G availability of 27.6% of the time, representing the proportion of time those users with 5G devices and subscription had an active 5G connection. Higher urban population areas like Illinois is where the money is for major carriers. Some of the reasons for such service are the flavors of 5G. Low-Band Mid-Band High-Band The higher the band, the faster transmission speeds are, at the expense of distance and penetrating building materials. The High-Band has much higher speed, yet degrades traveling a few hundred feet of open space, and worsens if trees are on its path. Other questions are how will smartphones receive 5G indoors and will there be 5G WiFi? Self-driving Cars \u00b6 Self-driving cars , also known as an autonomous vehicles (AV), driverless car, Auto Pilot, Full Self-Driving, Super Cruise, robotic car (robo-car), and other marketing terms, are incorporating automation.

Some withdrew early and some have literally crashed, burned, killed, or disobey traffic laws, in their Hype Curve race. Levels of Autonomous Driving Explained To set agreed-upon standards early in the transition to autonomous vehicles, the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) developed a classification system that defines the degree of driving automation a car and its equipment may offer.

In the future, if a vehicle has Level 3, Level 4, or Level 5 automated driving systems, the technology takes complete control of the driving without human supervision. However, with Level 3, if the vehicle alerts the driver and requests she takes control of the vehicle, she must be prepared and able to do so. As of 2022, no vehicles sold in the U.S. market have a Level 3, Level 4, or Level 5 automated driving system.

Team members use the Website Development Stack to develop and deploy websites to the Internet. There would be confusion and possible defects created if Team members were to directly make changes to the central project repository. A solution to this problem is to have one central repository controlled by a team member gatekeeper. Each team member forks a copy of central project repository to their GetHub account and makes a clone of it on their workstation. Each developer makes changes to their repository clone .

Team members use the Website Development Stack to develop and deploy websites to the Internet. There would be confusion and possible defects created if Team members were to directly make changes to the central project repository. A solution to this problem is to have one central repository controlled by a team member gatekeeper. Each team member forks a copy of central project repository to their GetHub account and makes a clone of it on their workstation. Each developer makes changes to their repository clone .
